# Blarglike

Blarglike is a small dungeon-crawling roguelike where you play as a tiny robot on a mission to restore life to a dying ecosystem. Venture deep into procedurally generated dungeons, plant flowers, and guide nutrients to help the environment thrive. Each day offers a fresh challenge with new dungeon layouts!

## Features
- **Daily Procedural Dungeons** â€“ Every day generates a unique dungeon to explore.
- **Simple, Intuitive Controls** â€“ Move with arrow keys, bump walls to shift nutrients (at a battery cost!).
- **Challenging Score-Based Gameplay** â€“ How deep can you go? How much life can you restore?
- **Minimalist and Relaxing** â€“ A blend of strategy and chill dungeon crawling.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys** â€“ Move your tiny robot.
- **Run into Walls** â€“ Spend battery power to push nutrients.
- **M Key** â€“ Toggle sound on/off.
